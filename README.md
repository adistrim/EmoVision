# EmoVision

EmoVision is a real-time emotion recognition project using deep learning. It captures video frames from a camera, detects faces, and predicts emotions in real-time using a pre-trained model.

## Features

- Real-time face detection and emotion recognition.
- Uses a trained deep learning model for accurate emotion predictions.
- Simple integration with OpenCV for video capture.
